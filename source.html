                        - Dependency injection
                        - Dependency injection container
                        - Difference from Service locator

                        Note:

                        I'll start with a rather long intro where I'll go
                        through some basic principles and best practices.
                        What's a dependency and dependency injection?
                        Dependency injection container and how not to use it as a service locator.
                        When service providers help.
                        Examples of service providers with Silex 2 and Pimple 3.
                        Reusing service providers between frameworks.
                        PSR11 and interoperability.

                            Note:

                            We have a Meetup class with the ability to add attendees.
                            Whenever it adds a new attendee, the `Meetup` class needs to order more beer.
                            It creates a new `Beer` instance and uses the `Brewery` to order it.

                            Note:

                            `Beer` and `Brewery` are dependencies of the `Meetup` class.
                            Actually a meetup cannot possibly function without them.

                            Note:

                            Dependency injection is nothing more than a design pattern
                            which has a simple goal. Move dependency creation out of the class
                            and inject ready instances via the constructor or setters.

                            You can see we've injected the `Brewery` as a dependency.
                            It needs to be created prior to creating the `Meetup` instance.

                            Note:

                            Here we've moved out the creation of new `Beer` instances
                            and instead have injected a `BeerFactory` which can create
                            new beers for us.

                            Some people think dependency injection is when the framework is
                            auto-magically injecting the required dependencies.

                            Some examples are AngularJS 1, Laravel service container, Silex actions.

                            Note:

                            Here you can see we have changed the type hints to interfaces.
                            By using interfaces we allow for any implementation
                            of the interface to be injected. The `Meetup` class states
                            to anyone who is injecting that it would rely only on the methods
                            defined in these implementations.

                            This way we could replace any specific implementation with another.
                            The higher-level service does not define the implementation details anymore.

                            A good example is a payment abstraction library which supports different payment processors.
                            Instead of the top-level payment library taking care of all the details it can allow
                            a `PaymentProcessorInterface` instance to be injected.

                            Note:

                            We can go a step further and get the preferred beer type
                            of the attendee and we can do that by using interfaces.

                            The attendee interface here does not assume the beer preference capability
                            which achieves the Interface segregation principle.

                            The beer factory can create a default beer type if null is passed.

                        Here's a very simple version of a container.
                        It's just an array which holds configuration and instantiated services.
                        You can imagine this is just pseudo code for a more robust
                        dependency injection container with lazy instances allowing
                        to override configuration.

                        ---------------

                        Dependency injection container could be used as a service&nbsp;locator.

                        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="php">
                        class MeetupController

                        </code></pre>

                        Note:

                        The service locator pattern is about injecting the whole container
                        in the classes that would need services out of it.

                        In most cases this could be considered an anti-pattern
                        and you can probably see why.
                        - You hide the real dependencies of the class.
                        - It's harder to test.
                        - It couples the configuration of the container with the code in the services.

                        Note:

                        When using the dependency injection container the services should not know about it.
                        They would continue to abide the dependency injection pattern.
                        The dependency injection container would be used from outside the services.
                        Of course some parts of a framework using a DIC could use it directly
                        to instantiate services and inject their dependencies.

                        The part of the system which would call the action would
                        probably know about the DIC, but the controller would not.
                        It would just expect things to be injected.

                        Note:

                        Configuring a few services with a dependency injection container
                        is easy. However when you have a ton of services in a larger application
                        and there a lot of services that depend on each other you can
                        make your life easier by using a service provider.

                        ---

                        Here is an example of `Pimple` and `DoctrineServiceProvider`.
                        The service provider is a simple class which can register one or several
                        services in the DIC and allow you to configure a few parameters
                        which would be correctly passed to the services.

                        - Silex 1 depends on Pimple 1.
                        - Silex 1 has the ability to register service providers.
                        - Silex 2 depends on Pimple 3
                        - Pimple 3 introduced the ability to register service providers.

                        Note:

                        Pimple is a very simple dependency injection container.
                        Silex is a micro-framework on top of Pimple and some Symfony components.

                            - You need to use only the register methods and do everything lazily.
                            - Another example is Laravel and Lumen which share the Laravel service container.
